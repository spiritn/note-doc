A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework’s IoC container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring’s Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies. The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming.

本篇参考文档涵盖了spring框架所有绝对必要的技术。

Spring框架中最重要的是Inversion of Control (IoC) container。spring是面向方法的AOP框架，它很容易理解，并且覆盖了企业开发中80%的场景，同时还覆盖了Spring与AspectJ（目前Java企业领域最丰富--功能最丰富--当然也是最成熟的AOP实现）的集成。
